# TypeScript Function: Missing Input Validation and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript coding error: insufficient input validation and error handling in a function. The `calculateArea` function is designed to calculate the area of different shapes, but it lacks comprehensive checks for invalid inputs and gracefully handles unsupported shapes.  This leads to potential unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version with improved validation and error handling.
